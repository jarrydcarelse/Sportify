## üõ† Built With <a name="built-with"></a>

### Tech Stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>

#### Frontend
- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is used for creating dynamic and interactive web pages, with a component-based architecture that makes the code more reusable and easier to maintain.

#### Backend
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js is used for building fast and scalable server-side applications.
- **Express.js:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Express is used for setting up the server and handling routes.

#### Database
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database program that uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is used for storing product information and user data.

#### Middleware
- **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. Axios is used for making API requests to the backend server.
- **CORS:** Middleware that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated. CORS is used for enabling cross-origin requests.

#### Authentication
- **JWT (JSON Web Token):** A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. JWT is used for securely transmitting information between the client and server as JSON objects.

#### Styling
- **CSS:** Used for styling the web pages to ensure a good user experience.
- **Bootstrap:** A popular CSS framework that helps to create responsive and mobile-first web pages.

#### Environment Variables
- **dotenv:** A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`. Used for managing configuration settings.

#### Additional Tools
- **Mongoose:** An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js. Mongoose provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model application data.

This tech stack enables Sportify to be a dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly platform for sports enthusiasts, providing robust functionality and a seamless user experience.
